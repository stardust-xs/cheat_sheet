# Nano :pencil:

This cheat sheet covers the usage of [**GNU nano**](https://www.nano-editor.org/) editor.<br>So basically, nano is a simple text editor written in [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and is shipped with all versions/distros of **Linux** by default.

Nano is installed by default, simple to use and is probably the easiest to learn from all command line editors, so lets get started.

**DISCLAIMER:** There are different ways of carrying out a particular thing in nano but, I'll be explaining the methods that I've been using so far and have proved to be more practical and simple to remember.

## Help

In case you don't want to follow along or want to learn nano by yourselves, you can click **Ctrl + G** to pop up the help menu.<br>The help menu is one-stop solution for all your queries related to nano. But it doesn't cover how you can combine the keystrokes to achieve shortcuts beyond the scope!

**NOTE:** You may see some weird keystroke pairs like **^**, **M-**, **Sh-** or (:arrow_up_small::arrow_forward::arrow_down_small::arrow_backward:).<br>These represent your **Ctrl**, **Alt** or **Esc**, **Shift** and **Directional arrow** keys respectively. Also one thing to note here is the fact that these shortcuts are **not** case-sensitive.

## Navigations

Although there are couple of ways of navigating through nano, the best and the most obvious way is to use the **directional arrow**<br>keys (:arrow_up::arrow_right::arrow_down::arrow_left:) on your keyboard. Their usage is simple as it can get, use them to move through the characters one by one (up-down/right-left).<br>The directional arrow keys paired with **Ctrl** key will let you move through the **entire word**.

**Ctrl + A** will let you go to the first character of the current line, **Ctrl + E** will let you move to the last character of the current line.<br>The same can be done using **Home** and **End** buttons respectively.

**Alt + \\** (backslash or key above the enter/return) will let you jump to the beginning of the document and **Alt + /** (forward slash or key besides shift) will let you jump to the end. This saves a lot of time when you need to append something to a long document.<br>The same can be performed using **Ctrl + Home** and **Ctrl + End**.

**Page Up** and **Page Down** will let you move a up and down **entire screen** worth of text. This is super useful when you need to navigate midway through a long document.

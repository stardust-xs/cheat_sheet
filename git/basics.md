# Git

This cheat sheet covers at least whatever basics you need to know about [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/).

**DISCLAIMER:** This may not cover everything that is out there about Git but I'll try my best to keep things simple and explain as much as possible.

**NOTE:** I've added hyperlinks to the topics that I won't be covering here in-depth but are **required*** for sake of "better" understanding.

## What is Git?

So, Git is a *distributed* [**Version Control**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) System (VCS) and not GitHub or GitLab.
It is a "thing" or a technology by itself, called as **Source Code Management** or [**SCM**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/source-code-management) in short.

There are bunch of tools out there for doing SCM like **CVS**, **Subversion** and **Perforce** but Git outclasses them by being a **Distributed** VCS. You can find more on that [**here**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). But in simple terms, a distributed vcs means that every user has a **copy of their work** (cloned/forked branch) which is "distributed" by the owner (master branch).

Distributing copies in this way keeps everybody's work seperate and gives them full liberty to develop new features or fix/patch existing problems. Once the user is satisfied with the developed code or patch it can be merged with the main code.
